Hi there and welcome to my public notes, or 'second brain'. Here I publicly share notes on interesting topics that I'm exploring. Don't consider anything you read here as absolute truth, as I may be wrong in my interpretation when I'm learning something new!

Below you find some links to an old (Wordpress) blog that I hosted for a while.
